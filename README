NAME

    Test::Easy - Testing made absolute easy.

SYNOPSIS

            use Test::Easy;
        
            TEST 'this is my 1st test',
            CODE { return 'true if this test passed ok' }
            ;
        
            TEST 'this is my 2nd test',
            CODE { return 'true if this test passed ok' }
            ;
        
            TEST 'this is my bad test',
            CODE { return undef or die "this test failed" }
            ;
        
            SKIP 'my 2nd test', 'just because ...';
            TODO 'my bad test', 'need it good one day ...';
        
            RUN;

DESCRIPTION

  JUST ABOUT

    Easy testing suite. No plans, no special testing logic. Absolutely easy
    just like this:

            do { TEST 'label' => CODE { return 'defined value' } and RUN }
        
    All other sub's should be just tools to decide whether to return
    'defined' or undef value.

    No plans at all. (Isn't it a bug if I forget to change number of plans?)

    SKIPs and TODOs are based on regular expression matching TEST labels.
    Just give your tests smart labels (/my/testing/group1) and enjoy.

    NOTE 1: what's SKIPped will never be 'TODO'.

    NOTE 2: both SKIP or TODO can be invoked from within CODE block to
    reflect run-time or conditional options. But don't expect to SKIP 'my
    self' when the test just run. (You can SKIP 'the other following tests'
    only)

    All tests are run by the RUN call. (Offering new testing ideas.) Order
    of tests remains same as they appeared within the script file. When
    died, it still reports usefull line numbers.
